## Learning 

### MongoDB
I am learning how to set up, host, run, and manage a MongoDB
Not just any MongoDB, but a GridFS MongoDB to store my large photos 

When logged into the Linux server run to run Mongo server
```cmd
mongosh
```
I am not sure why mongod or anything else fails, but I will need to correct this eventally
